RESPONDER,Responder derivation,Computation,IF (.Z<CHG<=-2) THEN CRIT1FL='Y' ELSE CRIT1FL='N'        
TTPNRELF,Time to first pain relief without worsening derivation,Computation,Derived from ADEF.ADY (where PARAMCD=XPPAIN and ADY>1) or ADAE.ASDY where CQ01NAM=PAIN EVENT.  Value is the earliest day when ADEF.CHG<0 (for an event) or (ADEF.CHG>0 or ADAE.ASDY>0) (for subjects censored due to pain worsening) or the last record where ADEF.CHG=0 (for subjects censored due to no improvement or worsening by the time of the last assessment)
TTPNRELF.CNSR,Censoring algorithm for Time to First Pain Relief,Computation,"if pain relief occurs before worsening, then CNSR=0; else if worsening from pain data, then CNSR=1; else if worsening from AE data, then CNSR=3; else if no relief and no worsening at time of last observation, then CNSR=4"
TTPNRELF.EVNTDESC,Event descriptions for Time to First Pain Relief,Computation,"if CNSR=0, then EVNTDESC=PAIN RELIEF; if CNSR=1, then EVNTDESC=PAIN WORSENING PRIOR TO RELIEF; if CNSR=2, then EVNTDESC=PAIN ADVERSE EVENT PRIOR TO RELIEF; if CNSR=3, then EVNTDESC=NO RELIEF AND NO WORSENING AT LAST ASSESSMENT"
TRTSDT,Date of first exposure to treatment derivation,Computation,"EX.EXSTDTC where EXSEQ=1, converted to a SAS date.  See SAP for missing or partial value imputations."
TRTEDT,Date of last exposure to treatment derivation,Computation,EX.EXENDTC converted to a SAS date for the last record in EX.  See SAP for missing or partial value imputations.
ITTFL,Intent-to-Treat flag derivation,Computation,"If ADSL.RANDDT ^= missing then Y, else Null"
SAFFL,Safety population flag derivation,Computation,"If ADSL.TRTSDT^=missing then Y, else Null"
RESPFL,Responder population flag derivation,Computation,"If XP.VISIT='Month 6' and XPSTRESN represents at least a two-point improvement from the baseline record then Y, else N"

ADAE.AENDY,Analysis end day calculation,Computation,AENDT - ADSL.TRTEDT + 1
ADTTE.SRCVAR,SRCVAR algorithm,Computation,SRCVAR = ADEF if first event is a negative pain score or if worsening occurs before an improvement.  SRCVAR = ADAE if ADAE.CQ01NAM is non-missing on a date prior to a pain improvement or worsening.  
ADTTE.SRCSEQ,SRCSEQ algorithm,Computation,if SRCVAR=ADEF then SRCSEQ=ADEF.XPSEQ from the corresponding record; else if SRCVAR=ADAE then SRCSEQ=ADAE.AESEQ from the corresponding record.
