COMMENTOID,COMMENT
COM.ARMCD,Assigned based on Randomization Number.
com.ae,"MedDRA dictionary version 21.1 was used to code all adverse events. Since only Preferred termis provided, most general LLT is assumed."
com.lb,"Standard Reference ranges from various internet sources are used where not provided. In case Lab Toxicity and Grade are generated from metadata but already present in dataset, then calculated Lab Toxicity and Grade replaces original otherwise Lab Toxicity and grade are retained. CTCAE grades are used. Can be replaced by updated lab grades. Where ranges differ in gender and age the lowest and highest have been used here as common just for test purposes. Will be changed for an actual submission."
com.ex,"Although only the placebo controlled arm is provided in this study, I have randomized rows according to stratification asked for in the protocol. Stratification was to be done according to ECOG PS (0 vs 1 vs 2), to prior curative surgery (pancreatectomy, yes vs no) and to geographical region. Exposure was Derived from actual observation of the administration of drug by the investigator. EX data was collected in mg for the active drug. The protocol requirement was for mg/kg. This was calculated by dividing the maximum weight of the subject whose value was derived from the VS domain data. EC domain is created containing information for the same. The Epoch cycles are copied from the raw data in the CRF."
com.ce,The ATC index from Website https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/ is used for WHODrug ATC codes
com.IE,"The full text for the inclusion/Exclusion Criterion is given below:  E09-Any of the following events within the 3 months prior to randomization: treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive oesophagitis or gastritis, grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal bleeding/hemorrhage, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolism, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event. E23-Inadequate liver function tests: Total bilirubin > 1.5 ULN, Transaminases (SGOT/SGPT) > 2.5 x ULN (unless liver metastasis are present, 5 x ULN in that case), Alkaline phosphatase > 3 x ULN (unless liver metastasis are present, 5 x ULN in that case). E07-History of another neoplasm.  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for > 5 years are allowed."
com.QS,"VISUAL ANALOG SCALE 100 is used to grade pain intensity. SUPPQS domain contains the 0-100 range for pain intensity that it can be used for analysis if needed. Since Pain intensity is the only QSTESTCD, Valuelevel Matadata is not required. DAY 1, VISIT 1 is considered the baseline reading."
